Invoice1 was a very interesting, yet challenging, WOD considering I put a lot of time and effort in it. In this WOD, I was tasked to create a sales recipt for a sale that consisted of five different products. First glancing at this, I thought I could just 'hard code' the table and impute my own prices and product names. However, this was not the case due to the fact that I had to compute my values dynamically with the page, which basically meant I could not hard code it. I am not going to lie, this WOD was confusing for me at first. I tried to do this assignment without watching the screencast but I did not get far into the assignment. So I watched the screencast for the assignment, and I realized that it was not confusing after all, I just had problems with understanding some of the questions on the assignment. Invoice1 was by far the longest WOD I worked on in this class because there were a good amount of repetitive changing of values and changing codes from hard copy to dynamically changing. What worked for me while doing Invoice1 was taking notes on the screencast because I encountered problems with misplaced quotations, calculating subtotals, and changing values from static to dynamically changing. 

To prepare for this WOD, I read the weekly readings to give me a brief introduction of what Invoice1 covers. In this week's readings I leaned about Java Script operators, assignment operators, addition, multiplication, etc. It became benefitial for me when doing this WOD because I had to compute strings and numbers for my different products and the readings helped me understand the difference between the two. Comparing this WOD to our previous WOD, it shares some similarity if we are talking about variables and values that are constantly changing. However, what made this WOD different from our previous WOD was the use of arithmitic operators and numerical expressions in coding. I had to pay close attention to the readings and the screencast because this is an area that is comletely new to me and I had to focus on what was expected. 

What I could have done to prepare differently for Invoice1 was to do more research and watch more videos on operators and expressions because even though I read the weekly readings and watched the screencast, I feel that I am still confused on the topic. To prepare for the next WOD, I will read more about numerical expressions and operators.
